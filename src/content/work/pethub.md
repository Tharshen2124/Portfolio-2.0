This project was made by Chong Wei Jie, Chong Jian Sieuang and I for our Final Year Project of our course Diploma in Information Technology.

Our main feature of this website is it offers booking appointments to pet healthcare facilities and grooming facilities. It also provides other services such as pet news where users can keep up to date on the latest pet related news such as new adoptions, pet missing cases, pet events, and many more. Not only that, Pethub also provides a forum feature where users can interact with one another to help give tips, advise or even solve each other’s own issues relating to their pets as well as a report feature where users can bring up any issues regarding the website or other user’s behavior.

For the service providers, our website offers pet healthcare facilities such as veterinary clinics and pet hospitals as well as pet grooming facilities to put up their facilities’ information and offer booking appointments to the users through our website. They can choose to accept or reject the appointments made by the user to check if the deposit was actually made or see if the information given is true. They can also use the pet news feature to promote any special offers they have to users as well as use the forums feature.

The administrator can ban users who are doing any suspicious or inappropriate activities using our website. They also have to reject or accept pet service provider applications and check if their SSM certificate is authentic or not. Besides that, they need to approve or reject news submitted by the users and pet service providers. The administrator can also view reports submitted by users as well as view, search, and delete forum posts and comments.
