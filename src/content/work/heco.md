A web application that uses an alogrithm to recommend the best healthcare facility for users. Algorithm will take in different factors. Factors include distance, cost, rating and reviews. We used a trained ML model to give a sentiment analysis of the reviews.

I worked together with 3 other members to create this during a hackathon called Sustainable Smart City Hackathon at Taylor's University, Malaysia.
